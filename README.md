# 🧩 Microfrontend Platform (React + Vue, Module Federation)

This project was created while completing an educational course and demonstrates a modern approach to building **microfrontends** using **React**, **Vue**, **Webpack Module Federation**, and an advanced Docker-based build setup.

## 🚀 Overview

### ✔️ **Microfrontends in React and Vue**
Each module is an isolated application built with either React or Vue, allowing different technologies to coexist within a single platform.

### ✔️ **Module Federation**
Dynamic component sharing between independent applications without requiring full rebuilds.  
This enables flexible architecture, scalable development, and rapid deployments.

### ✔️ **Smart Docker Build Architecture**
The project uses a multi-container Docker setup with intelligent layer caching and separation.  
Benefits include:
- Faster build times  
- Independent deployment of each microfrontend  
- Improved scalability and modularity  

### ✔️ **Multi-tier Navigation**
An advanced navigation system connecting the main shell application with nested microfrontends — similar to real enterprise-grade UI platforms.

### ✔️ **AWS Deployment (Work in Progress)**
Once the course is completed, the project will be deployed to AWS  
(CloudFront / S3 / ECS depending on the final architecture).

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React**
- **Vue**
- **Webpack 5 + Module Federation**
- **Docker**
- **Node.js**
- **AWS (planned)**

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn advanced frontend architectures  
- Practice building real-world microfrontend systems  
- Master containerized development with Docker  
- Structure the project similar to enterprise environments  

## 📌 Project Status

The course is not yet finished.  
More modules, improvements, and full CI/CD with AWS deployment will be added as progress continues.
